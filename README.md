## 🧙‍♂️ Embarking on Your Quest

To set forth on your development quest, ensure you're equipped with the following mystical tools and knowledge:

### 📜 Prerequisites

- A keen spirit for adventure.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine to conjure the runtime environment.
- `yarn` to weave your dependencies into the fabric of your project. If not already in your arsenal, you can acquire it through the following enchantment:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

### 🧙‍♀️ Setting Up the Enchanted Environment

1. **Conjure up the project dependencies** by navigating to your project's sanctum (project directory) and invoking the following spell:

```bash
yarn
```

### 🔮 Stirring the Cauldron of Development

1. **Awaken the server spirits** with a potent development spell:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Peer into your crystal ball (or open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser) to behold the application in action. The spirits will whisper (auto-reload) should you alter any scrolls (files) within your project.
